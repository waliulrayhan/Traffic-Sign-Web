## Installation

### Prerequisites
The app requires OpenCV for image processing functionalities. The OpenCV folder has been kept in a separate repository to reduce the size of this Android app repository.

- **Download the OpenCV library** from the dedicated repository: [OpenCV Back-up for Traffic Signs Classification Android App](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/OpenCV-Back-up-for-Traffic-Signs-Classification-Android-App)

  Or download directly from [here](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/OpenCV-Back-up-for-Traffic-Signs-Classification-Android-App/raw/main/opencv.zip).
  
  _[**Note**: It may take a few moments for the download to begin, as GitHub generates a direct download link for large files.]_

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Android-App-of-Traffic-Signs-Classification-using-CNN.git
   cd Android-App-of-Traffic-Signs-Classification-using-CNN
   ```
2. Extract the downloaded `opencv.zip` into your Android project directory.
3. Open the project in Android Studio.
4. Ensure that your development environment is set up with the necessary SDKs and tools.
5. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Point your deviceâ€™s camera at a traffic sign.
3. The app will detect and classify the sign, displaying the classification result in real-time.

---

## Model Integration

The app uses a TensorFlow Lite model (`model_trained.tflite`) that was converted from the original trained CNN model. This enables the app to perform efficient on-device inference, ensuring fast and responsive user interactions.

### Model Conversion

The original CNN model, trained using Keras, was converted to a TensorFlow Lite format for use in mobile applications.
