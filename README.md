# Traffic Signs Classification Project

This repository contains the code for both a **Web Application** and an **Android Application** for Traffic Signs Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is designed to recognize various types of traffic signs and classify them accurately, aiding in applications such as driver assistance and autonomous vehicle systems.

## Overview

This project leverages a trained CNN model to classify traffic signs into different categories. It includes:
- A **web application** built with Python, Flask, and Tailwind CSS.
- An **Android application** that uses the TensorFlow Lite version of the CNN model for on-device classification.

The CNN model is trained using Keras and TensorFlow and can classify traffic signs into 43 different categories.

## Features

- **Web Application**:
  - Real-time traffic sign classification.
  - Displays the identified traffic sign with a probability score.
  - User-friendly interface built using Flask and styled with Tailwind CSS.

- **Android Application**:
  - Real-time traffic sign detection using the device's camera.
  - Intuitive and mobile-optimized user interface.
  - Efficient and fast on-device classification with TensorFlow Lite.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Mobile Frameworks**: Android SDK, TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, CameraX
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Handling and Visualization**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Miscellaneous**: ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, Pickle for model storage
